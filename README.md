This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `About this site`

This site replaces my old one that was written in Vue.js.  This version is written in React. My intent is not to play favorites; I just wanted to code it differently this time.

As of this writing (the weee morning hours of 30-Oct-2019) it is only a few days old, so hopefully a lot more will be coming up.  For now though feel free to browse, check out my pet pics, and play around with any programs I have written.
