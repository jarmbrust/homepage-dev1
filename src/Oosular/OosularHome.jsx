        <h2 className="sub-title">The Western Lands of the Continent of Ous, and its Eastern Frontier</h2>
        <p>
          In a time before the Reckoning, thousands of years after the fall of the ancient god-kings of Xantavar to
          the Dragon Lords of Tor, and the rise and fall of the demonic Blood Empire, fifteen hundred years after
          the Necromancers of Prentos failed in their bid for immortality
          and were cast down by the Murn'Ator, eight hundred years after the mighty Nokoyan Empire crumbled from within, 
          and over a century after the last of the barbarian warlords of the Kaza-Groth retreated to the northeast, 
          the lands of the western edge of the continent of Ous knew some measure of peace...
        </p>
        <p>
          For over three generations of men peace and prosperity spread across the lands.  There were bad years of course, but overall crops prospered, towns sprung up, 
          kingdoms expanded, and cities grew.  Eventually expansion and growing populations took its toll, and as tensions flared when borders were 
          disputed, and the armies of the ruling cities skirmished here and there.  The three great human cities of the region: 
          Kiron, Vrentae, and Isensall, had a fragile truce that had lasted for decades.  But many believed it was only a matter of time before 
          open war broke out and shattered the last 110 years of peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The machinations of nobility within the courts of the great cities were little more than passing gossip and rumor on the frontier, however.  
          On the eastern most edge of the civilized west the influence of the three great cities was tenuous at best. Few cared about what the
          nobles of the western courts wanted, for the frontier was a rugged placed where only the strong and cunning survived and prospered, 
          and your worth was proven (for the most part) by what you did, not by whose blood was in your veins.  ...of course, most of the 
          keeps of the frontier were ruled over by blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lesser nobles, knights, and other minor royalty who were either recklessly ambitious or outcast from the prestigious courts of the west, 
          owned and lorded over the tiny fiefdoms on the frontier.  From those fiefdoms grew the keeps that protected the west from what lie beyond.
          These rulers staked out claims on soil made rich by history and the bones of ancestors.  Lands that were once held by the tribes 
          of the Kaza-Groth who fought against the Nokoyan war machine.
          Before that, the lands had been stalked by the Murn'Ator in search of infidels within the cities of the nine Kingdoms of 
          Kannamos.  The last of the "true" dragons flew the skys above these very lands many centuries
          before that, rising on currents of air blowing over the even then ancient tombs of the half-demon sorcerers of the Blood Empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the history, legends of powerful artifacts, and whispers of treasure attracted both fortune hunters and thrill seekers eager to
          delve the depths and brave the risks for fame and riches.  Many have lost their lives in the attempt, some their very souls.  But just as
          adventurers populate the frontier, so too do indentured servants and criminals working off debts, peasants following their lords east, and,
          in some places, slaves who toil away far from sympathetic eyes and western laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Laws on the frontier that exist are made by those with the strength to enforce them, and rulers of most keeps do try to enforce
          an order upon what would otherwise lawless anarchy.  The laws they make are usually few, but with harsh and draconian punishments...
          from being chained in a dungeon and forgotten, to years of indentured servitude or even slavery to pay your debts, and most commonly 
          execution for many of the more serious offenses.  Even with harsh punishments, crime is rampant, and travelers would be wise to 
          keep an eye on their coin purse, and their back.  But such threats do little to dissuade those that do make the trip to the east.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a caravan to Oronburn, a place on the frontier sometimes referred to as "The Last Haven", travelers are huddled against the 
          pouring rain in the back of an open cart.  Driven by an old dwarf and his two misshapen beasts of burden, the travelers 
          felt every rock and hole the wagon rolled over.  They looked east past the dwarf and his beasts, and towards the hopes 
          of finding fame, fortune, or just a chance to start a new life on the frontier.
