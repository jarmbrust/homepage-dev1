          <p>
            In a time before the Great Reckoning, thousands of years after the fall of the ancient god-kings of Xanotus to
            the Dragon Lords of Tos, fifteen hundred years after the Necromancers of Prentos failed in their bid for immortality
            and were cast down by the Murn'Ator, eight hundred years after the mighty Nokoyan Empire crumbled from within, 
            and over a century after the last of the barbarian warlords of the Kaza-Groth retreated to the northeast, 
            the lands of the western edge of the continent of Ous knew some measure of peace...
          </p>
          <p>
            For over three generations of men peace and prosperity spread across the lands.  There were bad years of course, but overall crops prospered, towns sprung up, 
            kingdoms expanded, and cities grew.  Eventually expansion and growing populations took its toll, and as tensions flared when borders were 
            disputed, and the armies of the ruling cities skirmished here and there.  The three great human cities of the region: 
            Aesana, Vrentae, and Rentu, had a fragile truce that had lasted for decades.  But many believed it was only a matter of time before open war broke 
            out and shattered the last 110 years of peace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The machinations of nobility within the courts of the great cities were little more than gossip and rumor in the frontier however.  
            On the eastern most edge of the civilized west the influence of the three great cities was tenuous at best. Few cared about what perfumed nobles in 
            courtly manors wanted, for the frontier was a rugged placed where only the strong and cunning survived and prospered, and your worth
            was proven (for the most part) by what you did, not by whose blood was in your veins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lesser nobles, knights, and other minor royalty who were either recklessly ambitious or outcast from the prestigious courts of the west, ruled over
            the tiny fiefdoms of the east.  From those tiny fiefdoms grew the keeps that protected the west from what lied beyond.
            These rulers staked out claims on ground made rich and fertile by the bones of the peoples who
            lived in the great empires of the past.  Lands that were once held by the tribes of the Kaza-Groth who fought against the technomancers of 
            the Nokoyan war machine.  Lands that had been stalked by the Murn'Ator in search of any infidels within the cities of the nine Kingdoms of 
            Kannamos -- infidels who would dare defy their great god.  The last of the "true" dragons flew the skys above these very lands many centuries
            before that, rising on currents of air blowing over the even then ancient tombs of the half-demon sorcerers of the Blood Empire.
          </p>

            All the history, rumors of artifacts, and whispers of treasure attracted both fortune hunters and thrill seekers eager to
            delve the depths and brave the risks for fame and riches.  Many have lost their lives in the attempt, some their very souls.  But just as
            adventurers populate the frontier, so too do indentured servants and criminals working off debts, peasants following their lords east, and,
            in some places, slaves who toil away far from sympathetic eyes and western antislavery laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laws on the frontier are made by those with the strength to enforce them, and some of the rulers of the keeps do try to enforce
            an order upon what would otherwise lawless anarchy.  Laws that do exist usually are few, but with harsh and draconian punishments... from being chained 
            in a dungeon and forgotten about, to indentured servitude or even slavery to pay your debts, and most commonly execution for many of the more
            serious offenses.  Even with harsh punishments, crime is rampant, and travelers would be wise to keep an eye on their coin purse, and their back.
            But this does little to dissuade those that do make the trip out east.
          </p>

            In a caravan to Serrato, a place on the frontier often known as "The Last Keep", travelers are huddled against the pouring rain in the back 
            of one of the open carts that make up the caravan, this one driven by an old dwarf and his two beasts of burden.  
            The travelers look to the east in the direction they are traveling, and towards the hopes of finding fame, fortune, 
            or just a chance to start a new life on the frontier.
